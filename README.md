This was side project back in 2017 while I was a second year Phd student. The code uses a Twitter package in R to download a follower's friends and runs a bayesian machine learning algorithm to determine who's a bot and who is not.

Unfortunately the code is as messy as they come, but I did leave some comments in the file that are recent and there are enough comments from 2017 to make getting through the code doable. 

The blog describing the work is on my website josephshaheen.com and is archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20210419175444/https://www.josephshaheen.com/portfolio/project-twitter-bot-classification-using-bayesian-machine-learning

Enjoy!
